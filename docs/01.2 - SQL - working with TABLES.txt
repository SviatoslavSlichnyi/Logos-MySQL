		                            Tables
	        Adding data:
INSERT INTO <table> (<field #1>, ...) 
	VALUES 
		(<values for field #1>, ...),
		(<values for field #1>, ...),
		...
		(<values for field #1>, ...),
		(<values for field #1>, ...); - inserting data into fields.



	        Updating data:
UPDATE <table SET ...,... ..., WHERE ...
UPDATE <table>
SET
    <field> = <a new value>,
    <field> = <a new value>,
    ...,
WHERE <specify the exact field>;

(Example: UPDATE `users` SET `name` = 'Kevin' WHERE id = 3)



            Deleting data:
DELETE FROM <table-name> WHERE <condition to know which elements to delete>;

WHERE operators:
    BETWEEN <from> AND <to>
    <field> IN (<it equals to this>, <it equals to this>, ..., <it equals to this>)
    <field> LIKE '<Some part of word>%' - (% - the end could be everything).

!!!BE CAREFUL:
TRUNCATE - to clear (delete) full table.
